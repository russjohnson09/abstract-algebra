Guidelines:
1. The statement of each problem must be written in its entirety, followed by the solution.

2. If you obtain an idea from someone else credit them.

3. Write in complete sentences.

4. Avoid run-ons.

5. Do not begin a sentence with a symbol.

6. As a writer, it is your job to make things clear to the reader. Do not use the words "clearly" or obviously.

7. Proofread. Use a spell-checker and be sure to re-read everything at least two times for accuracy and clarity before submitting.


Understand your audience.
