Activity 25.7 shows us how we can use quotients of groups for induction proofs.  We are proving Theorem 25.5 is true for $U_{21}$. The prime divisors of $|U_{21}| = 12$ are $2$ and $3$. From Corollary 24.5 we now that at least one element exists with order $2$ or $3$. We assume that there is an element that has order $2$ and prove that there must also exists an element with order $3$. We will do something similar to this when proving this for the general case.
