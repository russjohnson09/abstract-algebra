In Activity 21.4 we proved the following theorem.\\
~\\
{\bf Theorem 21.4} {\it Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group of order $n$. For each positive divisor $m$ of $n$, there is exactly one subgroup of $G$ of order $m$, and these are the only subgroups of $G$.}\\
~\\
We did this by first showing that there does exist a subgroup of $G$ for some positive divisor $m$ of $n$. We then showed that two subgroups of order $m$ must be equal to each other. Finally, based on Theorem 21.3 part (ii) the only subgroups of $G$ are ones that have order $m$.\\

In Activity 21.5 part (a) we found that all generators of $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ are of the form $k[n]$ where $k$ is coprime with $30$. This satisfied the biconditional statement, $a^k$ is a generator for $G$ if and only if $gcd(k,n)=1$. In part (b) we had an example of a group with generator $a$ with order $15$ that also satisfies the biconditional statement. Finally, in part (c) we proved this for the general case using Theorem 21.3 part (ii) and Theorem 21.4.
