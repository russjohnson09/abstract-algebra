In Activity 26.1 we investigated the operation table of the direct product of the two groups $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$. From this operation table we see things that we might expect to be true. The identity of $\mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_3$ contains the identity of $\mathbb Z_2$ and the identity of $\mathbb Z_3$. The operation of $\mathbb Z_2\oplus \mathbb Z_3$ is the operation of $\mathbb Z_2$ applied to the first element in the pair and the operation of $\mathbb Z_3$ applied to the second element in the pair. In this activity we also constructed a subgroup of $\mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_3$ that contained every element of $\mathbb Z_3$.
