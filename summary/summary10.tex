For Activity 22.2 we first noted that all of the rotations in a dihedral group could be represented using a single rotation and its powers. We then showed that all of the reflections in an $n$-gon could be represented with a single reflection and a rotation to some integer power. And so, we can represent all of the symmetries in a dihedral group with a single reflection and a rotation. In other words instead of having $D_n=\{I,R,R^2,\ldots, R^{n-1},r,r_2,\ldots,r_n\}$ we have $D_n=\{I,R,R^2,\ldots, R^{n-1},r,rR,rR^2, \ldots,rR^{n-1}\}$ for some dihedral group.
